                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">We will be engaging with the community in Glenuig, Moidart to revive the Atlantic Rainforests. A tiny remnant of the ancient oak woodland still stands here. However this fragile ecosystem is endangered by three threats : overgrazing deer, rhododendron invasion, community disengagement. </p>
                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">To catalyse the return of the Atlantic Rainforests, and to embody a rewilding project, Trees for Hope is engaging with the community to assist in their efforts to create the conditions for a vibrant ecosystem to exist. </p>
                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">In our Community and Rainforests Engagement Weeks, we invite people from the community to get involved in rhododendron removal, alongside our volunteers from other communities and participants from the Fertile Crescent. </p>
                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">As well as rhododendron removal, each participant will have opportunities to harmonise with nature. A greater sense of interconnection with nature and community may be realised when we engage to help nature and ourselves recover from damages of the past, and turn towards our sense of wholeness.</p>
                    <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">We intend our weeks of Engagement to be efficient, fun, and fulfilling. We hope our weeks will spark new connections and encourage growth. By engaging with nature, communities, and people from other parts of the world, we are creating decisive opportunities for transformation, connection, and healing.</p>
